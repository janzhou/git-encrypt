# Transparent Git Encryption

This project based(forked) on [git-encrypt][8] by Woody Gilk(@shadowhand) but diverged and hard to
merge back. It has own uniq features.
The original gitcrypt tool is inspired by [this document][1] written by [Ning Shang][2],
which was in turn inspired by [this post][3]. Without these two documents,
by people much smarter than me, gitcrypt would not exist.

> There is [some controversy][4] over using this technique, so do your research
and understand the implications of using this tool before you go crazy with it.

## Features

* Using strong master key to encrypt data.

* Master key can be encrypted/decrypting through such facilities:

  * *GPG*. The most secure way because master key not stored anywhere unencrypted. It has some performance issue because of decrypting is made on ANY FILE while commit/checkout/stage/diff/merge. Also it is possible to encrypt master key for multiple users(which PUBLIC keys you have) and can be used in multiuser encrypted repo.

  * *passphrase*. The master key is decrypted once on repo initialization and stored in .git/config.

  * *SSH private-key*. It is suitable ONLY for personal use because ssh-private key is used to encrypt/decrypt master key. There is no public/private facility used but master key is encrypted with *sha512* hash of ssh-private key internals(decrypted if needed). The master key is decrypted once on repo initialization and stored in .git/config. _This made for users who has ssh-key but no gpg key_

* It possible to merge(and resolve conflicts) in encrypted commits. It is realized by custom merge driver "gitcrypt-merge"

* You can encrypt previous repo history with command:

	$ gitcrypt crypthistory
	$ You MUST run 'crypthistory' BEFORE any encrypted commits.Do you want to recrypt all history? This may corrut your data? [Y/n]
	$ ...
    
* You can encrypt/decrypt all history:

	$ gitcrypt crypthistory
	$ gitcrypt decrypthistory
    
* You can enable/disable gitcrypt facility:

  $ gitcrypt disable
  $ gitcrypt reset
  $ gitcrypt enable
  $ gitcrypt reset
    
* You can add multiple users to allowed to encrypt master key when using GPG:
    $ gitcrypt init
    $ Please select masterkey encryption type:
    $ type 'gpg' for use gpg
    $ type path to ssh-private key ex: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    $ or type <passphrase> wich will encrypt masterkey
    $ *gpg*
    ...
    $
    $ You did not specify a user ID. (you may use "-r")
    $ 
    $ Current recipients:
    $ 2048R/DEFD08C4 2015-01-13 "Samoilenko Yuri <kinnalru@gmail.com>"
    $ 
    $ Enter the user ID.  End with an empty line: gitcrypt@gmail.com
    $ 
    $ Current recipients:
    $ 2048R/370F9A12 2015-05-30 "gitcrypt <gitcrypt@gmail.com>"
    $ 2048R/DEFD08C4 2015-01-13 "Samoilenko Yuri <kinnalru@gmail.com>"
    $
    $ Enter the user ID.  End with an empty line: 
    ...

    Now kinnalru@gmail.com and gitcrypt@gmail.com can decrypt repo with own private gpg key.


## Requirements
Openssl and git must be installed and the binary must be available in your $PATH.

## Installation

Clone gitcrypt somewhere on your local machine:

    $ git clone https://github.com/kinnalru/gitcrypt
    $ cd gitcrypt

The `gitcrypt` command must be executable:

    $ chmod 0755 gitcrypt

And it and it's internal files must be accessible in your `$PATH`:

    $ export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)"

### Gentoo

Or you can use my home little overlay for Gentoo: https://github.com/kinnalru/hoverlay

### For Windows

**Verified on PortableGit Only !**

Copy the file gitcrypt to your PortableGit/bin location. In my environment PortableGit is
available at E:\PortableGit. 

> copy gitcrypt E:\PortableGit\bin

Also make sure that PATH environment variable has E:\PortableGit\bin 
available in it.

> Path=C:\Python27\;C:\Python27\Scripts;E:\PortableGit\bin;E:\PortableGit\libexec\git-core;C:\windows\system32;C:\windows\;C:\window
> s\system32\WBEM;c:\windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\;c:\i386\~configs;C:\Users\VKHANORK\AppData\Roaming\Python\Scripts


## Configuration

To quickly setup gitcrypt interactively, run `gitcrypt init` from the root
of your git repository. It will ask you for an encrypt facility GPG/SSH/passphrase,
cipher mode, and what files should be encrypted.

    $ cd my-repo
    $ gitcrypt init

Useful example to mark *.skip files not-encryptable:

  	$ cat .git/info/attributes
    $ * filter=encrypt diff=encrypt merge=encrypt
    $ .gitcryptsecret filter diff merge text
    $ .gitattributes filter diff merge text
    $ *.skip text diff merge filter
    $ [merge]
    $    renormalize=true


Your repository is now set up! Any time you `git add` a file that matches the
filter pattern the `clean` filter is applied, automatically encrypting the file
before it is staged. Using `git diff` will work normally, as it automatically
decrypts file content as necessary.

### Manual Configuration

You can manually modify .git/config file:

    $ [gitcrypt]
    $   cipher = aes-256-cbc
    $   pass = gpg           # if gpg used
    $   pass = ~/.ssh/id_rsa # if ssh-private key used
    $   pass =               # empty if passphrase used
    $   secret =             # empty if gpg used 
    $   secret ="hnlR6m#sQY02HcD^22)k0EhMpf&SF*fxY&i4j0gCMdRKuVuI"
    $   salt = 7214e82f24d5511d
    $ [filter "encrypt"]
    $   smudge = gitcrypt smudge
    $   clean = gitcrypt clean
    $ [diff "encrypt"]
    $   textconv = gitcrypt diff
    $ [merge "encrypt"]
    $   name = gitcrypt merge driver
    $   driver = gitcrypt-merge %A %O %B %L


Next, you need to define what files will be automatically encrypted using the
[.git/info/attributes][6] file. Any file [pattern format][7] can be used here.

To encrypt all the files in the repo:

    * filter=encrypt diff=encrypt merge=encrypt
    [merge]
        renormalize = true

To encrypt only one file, you could do this:

    secret.txt filter=encrypt diff=encrypt merge=encrypt

Or to encrypt all ".secure" files:

    *.secure filter=encrypt diff=encrypt merge=encrypt

> If you want this mapping to be included in your repository, use a
`.gitattributes` file instead and **do not** encrypt it.


## Decrypting Clones

To set up decryption from a clone, you will need to repeat the same setup on
the new clone.

First, clone the repository, but **do not perform a checkout**:

    $ git clone -n git://github.com/johndoe/encrypted.get
    $ cd encrypted

> If you do a `git status` now, it will show all your files as being deleted.
Do not fear, this is actually what we want right now, because we need to setup
gitcrypt before doing a checkout.

Now you can either run `gitcrypt init` or do the same manual configuration that
performed on the original repository.

Once configuration is complete, reset and checkout all the files:

    $ gitcrypt reset

All the files in the are now decrypted and ready to be edited.


**Note that if you have diffrent salt you will see that files _modified_ but `git diff` show none.
This will lead to *grown up* of repository because all encrypred files will considered as changed**
